Countries Chosen:
-
-

Patterns needed:
- (Abstract?) Factory Method
        Factories will have different ways to make the coins (manufacturing process)
- Singleton - Concrete Mint factories will be singletons
- NullObject might be used for when a coin fails a manufacturing step
- Strategy can be used with the smelting process, since each coin has a different composition of metals

Implementations:
- Mint factory abstraction
- 2 Country mint concrete factories
- Coin abstraction
- coin factory for each country's coins?
- Singleton class/constructor for the concrete factories
- Concrete coin that is a NullObject
- Smelting strategy class, with different classes(/interfaces)? for the different metal compositions.
    Smelting would connect to coin abstraction, which would require a SmeltingBehavior attribute and smelt()
    method that would call the smelt method of the SmeltingBehavior 

Feature 1:
- Add factory method part of design, implement creator and product classes

Feature 2:
- Add singleton implementation to concrete factories

Feature 3:
- Add null object to coin implementation

Featue 4:
- Add strategy design to coin implementation

Rule of Thumb for testing:
    For every production class, there should be one testing class. For each production method, there
    should be at least one test method.

Classes:
    - Mint Factory:
      * Creator Classes:
        + Mint factory abstraction
            - abstract createCoin() method, which is the factory method
            - 
            -

        + Country1 factory concrete
            - implement factory methods
        + Country2 factory concrete
            - implement factory methods
                (will eventually implement Singleton pattern for each factory)

      * Product Classes:
        + Coin abstraction
            - value
            - name
        + Different kinds of Coins for each country
                (will eventually implement strategy pattern for metal comp)
            - TwoDollar
            - Dollar
            - HalfDollar
            - Quarter
            - CADQuarter
            - Dime
            - CADDime
            - Nickle
            - CADNickle
            - Penny
    
    - NullCoin: (NullObj, f3)
        - will extend the coin abstraction

    - Smelt Composition: (Strategy, f4) interface?
        -  Will need seperate classes for each smelt composition to be implemented,
           all will implement the interface
